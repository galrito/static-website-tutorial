I have endeavoured in this Ghostly little book, 
to raise the Ghost of an Idea, which shall not put my 
readers out of humour with themselves, with each other, 
with the season, or with me.  May it haunt their houses
pleasantly, and no one wish to lay it.

Their faithful Friend and Servant, 
C. D. 

December, 1843.
